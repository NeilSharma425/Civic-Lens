🚀 CivicLens – MVP Hackathon Blueprint
🎯 Core Hackathon Deliverable
A demo web app where users can:
Upload civic feedback (survey responses, short texts, or audio).


AI translates (if non-English).


AI rewrites into inclusive, clear summaries.


Dashboard shows sentiment trends + representation gaps.



⚙️ Tech Stack (MVP)
Frontend
React + Tailwind → clean, fast UI.


Chart.js or Recharts → simple data visualization (sentiment pie chart, demographics bar chart).


Backend
FastAPI (Python) or Flask → lightweight API for handling requests.


Supabase / Firebase → quick storage (survey data + user accounts).


AI Components
Translation →


Use OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for multilingual translation (fast + accurate).


Backup: HuggingFace MarianMT or Google Translate API.


Sentiment Analysis →


Use pre-trained HuggingFace model (e.g., distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2).


Classifies positive / neutral / negative.


Bias & Representation Detection (MVP) →


Use simple keyword + demographic tagging (e.g., detect “Spanish,” “immigrant,” etc. from metadata).


AI highlights underrepresented groups in feedback.


Inclusive Rewriting →


Use GPT-4o-mini prompt: “Rewrite this feedback in clear, respectful, culturally inclusive language.”


Optional Voice Input (stretch) →


Whisper (OpenAI speech-to-text) to transcribe audio memos.



🧩 MVP Demo Flow
Upload Feedback: User pastes text or uploads .csv of survey responses.


Processing:


If foreign language → translate.


Run sentiment analysis → positive/neutral/negative.


AI rewrites for inclusivity.


Dashboard Output:


Pie chart: % positive/neutral/negative.


Bar chart: sentiment by demographic group.


Highlight: “Spanish speakers report 40% lower satisfaction than others.”


Download/Share: Export PDF summary → “Insights for Policymakers.”



📌 Hackathon Pitch Expansion
Problem: “Immigrant + minority voices are underrepresented in civic feedback.”


Solution: “CivicLens bridges the gap with AI translation, inclusivity rewriting, and equity dashboards.”


Impact: “Policymakers see representation gaps clearly → more equitable policies.”


Scalability: Could be adopted by schools, city councils, healthcare boards.



🛠️ What’s Hackathon-Ready (MVP)
✅ Basic web UI (React)


✅ File/text input → pipeline with translation + sentiment analysis


✅ Inclusive rewriting with GPT


✅ Simple dashboard (Chart.js)


✅ Demo dataset (mock survey responses in English + Spanish)



🔥 With this setup, you’ll have a working prototype that:
Feels real to judges


Clearly communicates civic impact


Is technically feasible in 1–2 days
