🤖 AI Model Strategy for CivicLens
1. Translation
✅ Use Pretrained API/Wrapper (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Google Translate, or HuggingFace MarianMT).


❌ Don’t train your own — translation needs huge corpora + compute.


Hackathon Tip: You can “wow” judges by showing Spanish/Chinese → English translation via API, then inclusive rewriting.



2. Sentiment Analysis
✅ Use Pretrained Model (e.g., HuggingFace distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2).


❌ Don’t train your own — sentiment classification is already solved well.


Hackathon Tip: Wrap it in a Python FastAPI endpoint, run all survey feedback through it, and show pie chart/bar chart in your dashboard.



3. Inclusive Rewriting
✅ Use Wrapper for GPT (few-shot prompting).


Example prompt:


 “Rewrite this community feedback in clear, respectful, culturally inclusive language without changing meaning.”



❌ Don’t train your own here — inclusivity rewriting is too nuanced. Instead, you shine by designing the right prompt.


Hackathon Tip: Show before/after transformation for a few feedback lines — that’s visually powerful for your pitch.



4. Bias & Representation Detection
✅ Program Your Own Lightweight Layer.


Example: Tag responses with metadata (e.g., “Language: Spanish” or “Self-identified: Immigrant”). Then calculate if certain groups have systematically more negative sentiment.


This can be custom-coded in Python (counting frequencies, comparing sentiment distributions).


Hackathon Tip: This is where you show originality: “Look, our app detects underrepresentation and bias gaps automatically.”



5. Voice Input (Stretch Goal)
✅ Use Pretrained Model (OpenAI Whisper or HuggingFace whisper-small).


❌ Don’t train — audio ASR is way too big for a hackathon.


Hackathon Tip: Even if you only demo one Spanish audio memo → English → dashboard, it’ll impress judges.



🔑 Hackathon MVP Rule of Thumb
Wrappers / Pretrained Models → Translation, Sentiment Analysis, Voice-to-Text, Inclusive Rewriting.


Your Own Programming → Data processing, demographic tagging, bias detection logic, dashboard visualization.


That way, you’re judged not just as “people who glued APIs together,” but as builders who added civic logic on top of AI.
